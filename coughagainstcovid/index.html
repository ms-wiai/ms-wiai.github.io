Rapidly scaling screening,  testing and quarantine has shown to be an effectivestrategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider the application of deep learning techniques to distinguish individuals with COVID from non-COVID byusing data acquireable from a phone.  Using cough and context (symptoms andmeta-data) represent such a promising approach.  Several independent works inthis direction have shown promising results. However, none of them report perfor-mance across clinically relevant data-splits.  Specifically, the performance where the development and test sets are split in time (retrospective validation) and across sites (broad validation). Although there is meaningful generalization across these splits the performance significantly varies (up to 0.1 AUC score). In addition, we study the performance on symptomatic and asymptomatic individualsacross these three splits.  Finally, we show that our model focuses on meaningful features of the input, ‘cough’ bouts for cough and relevant symptoms for context.

                    We develop a CNN-based framework that ingests spectrogram representations of audio and directly predicts the probability of the presence of COVID-19.

                     For our context-based classification task, we leverage TabNet as our classifier.

                     For every individual, we get predicted probabilities p(y= 1|xcough) and p(y=1|xcontext) from the individual classifiers. For our final prediction we use a simple  ensembling scheme that averages the predictions from the two classifiers.

                    We can see that when considering a wider region, the higher frequency features automatically shrink toward zero, providing the network with lower-frequency inputs. As the region narrows, these features converge to the original positional encoding.

                    We collect this dataset from individuals who have undergone a COVID-19 test, from numerous testing sites across the country. In addition, contextual data such as symptoms,travel history, contact with confirmed case and demographic information etc is collected .  Unlike crowd-sourced datasets that rely on self-reported COVID-19 status, our ground-truth is lab test results from the healthcarefacilities.  This dataset consists of 12,780 cough sounds from 4,260 individuals from 27 differentsites. 1,394 have a positive test result and 2866 remaining are tested negatives.

                    Given the clinical uncertainty of this task and the use of deep learning for it, it is essential for clinicians to qualitatively understand the model behaviour and its predictions.  As a sanity check, we employ GradCAM++ to compute these saliency map.  We consistently observe that the focus-areas are on and around the cough bouts.  This reinforces the belief that the model is indeed making predictions based on coughsignal and otherwise.
                    <br>
                    For the context-based classifier, we use Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to understand which specific features help the model differentiate between COVID+ and COVID- patients at an instance level.

Normal NeRF (left) is not capable of learning to represent the same scene at multiple levels of detail, with blurring in close-up shots and aliasing in low resolution views, while mip-NeRF (right) both preserves sharp details in close-ups and correctly renders the zoomed-out images.
